# ᕦʕ •ᴥ•ʔᕤ Hugo moddedBear

The Hugo moddedBear theme is a lightweight [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on the following:
- [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev)
- [Hugo Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog)
- [Bear Cub (from which this theme is forked)](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub)

This theme has many of the same goals as Bear Blog and the various other themes inspired from it. It's fast and minimal, but it also strives to provide some of the more advanced features many personal bloggers will appreciate out of the box.
